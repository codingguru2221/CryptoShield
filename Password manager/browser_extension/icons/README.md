# Extension Icons

Place the following icon files in this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create these icons using any image editor or online icon generator. The icons should represent a password manager or security theme.

For now, you can use any PNG images with the correct dimensions as placeholders.
